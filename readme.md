## Setup
## User Test
In this link we can see a demonstration of the current state of the build and most of its features, both building a level and playing it.

We also have an infographic with all the inputs needed to build a level, wich will be shown as soon as the player boots the game and can be seen again at will through an option on the main menu.

When talking about level saving and loading, we have developed a slot system, allowing us to save three different levels at the same time and load them at will through the save and load buttons in the main menu.
