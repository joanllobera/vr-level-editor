We also have an infographic with all the inputs needed to build a level, wich will be shown as soon as the player boots the game and can be seen again at will through an option on the main menu.

When talking about level saving and loading, we have developed a slot system, allowing us to save three different levels at the same time and load them at will through the save and load buttons in the main menu.

## Setup
To test the experience, install the .apk file in the Oculus Quest following the instructions from the following link: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-adb/?device=QUEST

Once the .apk is installed in the Oculus Quest, simply execute it to test the experience.

In the editor, there is a tutorial that explains how to use the tool and the controls are always accessible to the user.
